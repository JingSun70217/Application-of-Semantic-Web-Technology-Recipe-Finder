# Application of Semantic Web Technology: Recipe Finder

 Recommend recipes based on the remaining food in the refrigerator.Our goal is to help users to manage the left-over ingredients. Among all the possible ways to achieve the goal, we focus on:
- How to complete a dish with minimum needs for extra ingredients;
- How to complete a dish with maximum usage of existing ingredients.
 
Implementation Steps:
1. Building the SPARQL Query by using JavaScript based on inputs from the user interface.
2. Interacting with Apache Jena Fuseki which is a SPARQL server that links multi ontologies.
3. Filtering recipes with minimum extra ingredients and maximum existing ingredients.
